## Abstract
In this project, logistic regression was used to solve two separate binary classifica-tion problems, one involving bankruptcy data and the other involving hepatitis data. Simple models were first trained to establish a benchmark. Various experimentswere then performed to attempt to improve on this result. The experiments can beclassified into feature selection and optimization parameter selection. The resultsof these experiments are presented, and the best model for each task is identified.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains 8 files:
* 2 Colab notebook files - Classifier_, hepatitis_feature_analysis.ipynb, and bankruptcy_feature_analysis.ipynb
* 2 Dataset files - breast-cancer-wisconsin.data and winequality-red.csv
* 1 ReadMe file - ReadMe.md
* 1 Project writeup - writeup.pdf

## Code Usage - (Python 3.6, Colab)
1. Upload python notebook to Colab
2. Select the required notebook (.ipynb file) and select "Run".

## More info
Code is also avaiable in GitHub
